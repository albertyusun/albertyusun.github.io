  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Hey, I’m Albert Sun!</h1>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m a junior at <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/">Duke University</a> studying <Strong>Computer Science</Strong> and <Strong>Math</Strong> originally from California. Right now, I'm doing a <Strong>Research Independent Study</Strong> advised by Professor Machanavajjhala on differential privacy. I'm researching methods to make accessing differentially private datasets fair and effective.

    In my free time, catch me learning jazz piano or planning fun arts & crafts events for my residents as an RA.

  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Summer 2021</h1>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">As a <strong>Data Engineering Intern</strong> at the Vera Institute of Justice in Brooklyn, NYC, I worked on developing the Incarceration Trends Project, the largest and most aggregate jail dataset in the country. Using Python, Google Cloud, and a suite of other database tools like SQLite, I developed data pipelines to scrape jail data from state and county websites to be displayed on the website. <a href="https://trends.vera.org/">Incarceration Trends Webtool</a></p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Last summer, I founded and directed an internship program called <strong>Tech for Equity</strong>. I matched 24 students with paid internships, scoped 10 software engineering and data science internship projects for interns, and managed a team of 4 technical project managers. Our team raised $61k total funding for first summer program costs and fellowship stipends. <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/tech-for-equity">News Coverage</a>. <a href="https://www.dukeaml.com/techforequity">Program Website</a>.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">More Projects</h1>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">In the spring, I competed in Duke's largest data competition, <strong>Duke DataFest </strong> (sponsored by the American Statistical Association). The competition's challenge was to make predictions on the likelihood of drug addiction from patients by using a dataset based on medical survey responses. My team won the <strong>Judges' Choice</strong> award for our work on experimentally exploring the importance on interpretable and explainable modeling (decision trees, additive boosting models, etc.) in clinical settings. <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/datafest/winners.html">News Coverage</a> </p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I worked on a <Strong>Bass Connections Research Project</Strong> led by Duke Law Professor Brandon Garrett to research the benefits for a publically-accessible online database for jails in North Carolina in the Wilson Center for Science and Justice. <a href="https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/harnessing-data-north-carolinas-jails-inform-effective-policies-2020-2021">Project</a>.</p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">As a <Strong>Data Plus Research Fellow</Strong> and <strong>Huang Fellow</strong>, I expanded my machine learning and NLP toolbox. I worked with a team of Duke professors and graduate students to investigate the early histories of consumerism. We used word2vec and multiple other language models in Python and R to conduct structural topic modeling and word embeddings on 26,000 old English texts. <a href="https://github.com/albertyusun/For-the-Love-of-Greed">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/love-greed-tracing-early-history-consumer-culture">Project Info</a>.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Hey, I’m Albert Sun!</h1>
    <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m a sophomore at Duke University studying <Strong>Data Science: Sociology and Racism</Strong>, a self-designed Bachelor’s degree program. I’m interested in leveraging data advocacy and personal narratives to combat structural racism in the legal system.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:albert.sun310@duke.com">albert.sun310@duke.edu</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-sun-17452177/">Linkedin</a>!</p>

	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m expanding my machine learning toolbox as a <Strong>Duke University’s Data Plus Fellow</Strong>. I’m working with a wonderful team led by Professor Astrid Giugni to investigate the early histories of consumerism. We're using TensorFlow, word2vec, and multiple other packages in Python and R to conduct structural topic modeling and word embeddings on 26,000 old English texts. <a href="https://github.com/albertyusun/For-the-Love-of-Greed">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/love-greed-tracing-early-history-consumer-culture">Project Info</a>.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">In addition, I’m investigating the intersection between science and law as a <Strong>Huang Fellow</Strong> in Duke’s Science and Society Initiative. A few of us have created the Huang Fellows <Strong>Racial Equity Committee</Strong>, and we're working to make structural reforms in Duke S&S in response to recent acts of racist police violence. <a href="https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/learn/undergraduate-programs/huang-fellows-program/profiles-of-huang-fellows/">Bio</a>.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Finally, I've begun my op-ed journey for the <Strong>Duke Chronicle</Strong>.

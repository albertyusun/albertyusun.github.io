  <!-- <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Hey, I’m Albert Sun!</h1>
    <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m currently a sophomore at Duke University studying <Strong>Data Science: Inequities in the Criminal Justice System</Strong>, a self-designed Bachelor’s degree program. I'm interested in studying how machine learning can support efforts to combat structural inequities.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Email me at <a href="mailto:albert.sun310@duke.com">albert.sun310@duke.edu</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-sun-17452177/">Linkedin</a>! Or check out my old school <a href = "https://www.albertyusun.com/resume">resume</a>.</p>
  
  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">What I'm doing now</h1>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I'm currently a <Strong>Legal/Data Science Intern</Strong> at the National ACLU's Capital Punishment Project, a team of defense lawyers promoting abolition and systemic reform of the death penalty process.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px"> I'm also a <Strong>Data Science Advocate</Strong> working with a Bass Connections Project led by Duke Law Professor Brandon Garrett to advocate for a database for jails in North Carolina in the Duke Law Center for Science and Justice. <a href="https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/harnessing-data-north-carolinas-jails-inform-effective-policies-2020-2021">Project</a>.</p>
  
  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">What I did over the summer</h1>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">As a <Strong>Data Plus Research Fellow</Strong>, I expanded my machine learning and NLP toolbox. I worked with a team of Duke professors and graduate students to investigate the early histories of consumerism. We used word2vec and multiple other packages in Python and R to conduct structural topic modeling and word embeddings on 26,000 old English texts. <a href="https://github.com/albertyusun/For-the-Love-of-Greed">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/love-greed-tracing-early-history-consumer-culture">Project Info</a>.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Furthermore, as a <Strong>Huang Fellow</Strong> in Duke’s Science and Society Initiative, I’m investigating the intersection between science and law. A few of us have created the Huang Fellows <Strong>Racial Equity Committee</Strong>, and we're working to make structural reforms in Duke S&S and invite Black speakers in response to recent acts of anti-Black police brutality. <a href="https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/learn/undergraduate-programs/huang-fellows-program/profiles-of-huang-fellows/">Bio</a>.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Finally, I began my op-ed journey for the <Strong>Duke Chronicle</Strong>. Check out my first piece which was featured as Top Story, "I wouldn’t exist without Black activism". <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/06/i-wouldnt-exist-without-black-activism-protests">Article</a>.</p>

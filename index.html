  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Hey, I’m Albert Sun!</h1>
    <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m a sophomore at Duke University studying <Strong>Data Science: Sociology and Racism</Strong>, a self-designed Bachelor’s degree program. I’m currently interested in studying how data science can be leveraged to inform policies that combat structural inequities.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Email me at <a href="mailto:albert.sun310@duke.com">albert.sun310@duke.edu</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-sun-17452177/">Linkedin</a>!

	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">As a <Strong>Data Plus Research Fellow</Strong>, I'm expanding my machine learning and NLP toolbox. I’m working with a team of Duke professors and graduate students to investigate the early histories of consumerism. We're using TensorFlow, word2vec, and multiple other packages in Python and R to conduct structural topic modeling and word embeddings on 26,000 old English texts. <a href="https://github.com/albertyusun/For-the-Love-of-Greed">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/love-greed-tracing-early-history-consumer-culture">Project Info</a>.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Furthermore, as a <Strong>Huang Fellow</Strong> in Duke’s Science and Society Initiative, I’m investigating the intersection between science and law.

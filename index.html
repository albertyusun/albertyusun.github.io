  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Hey, I’m Albert Sun!</h1>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m a junior at <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/">Duke University</a> studying <Strong>Computer Science</Strong> and <Strong>Math</Strong>. I'm passionate about applying and scaling research/technical tools to real world problems. In my free time, catch me learning jazz piano or working on my events for my residents as an RA.

  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Right now, I'm doing a <Strong>Research Independent Study</Strong> advised by Professor Machanavajjhala to do research on differential privacy and fairness. Differential privacy is a privacy standard; I'm researching methods to make accessing differentially private datasets fair and effective. Learn what Differential Privacy is here: <a href="https://medium.com/georgian-impact-blog/a-brief-introduction-to-differential-privacy-eacf8722283b">Differential Privacy</a></p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">As a <strong>Data Engineering Intern</strong> at the Vera Institute of Justice, I had the opportunity to work on further developing the Incarceration Trends Project, the largest and most aggregate jail dataset in the country. Using Python, Google Cloud, and a suite of other database tools like SQLite, I developed data pipelines to scrape jail data from state and county websites to be displayed on the website. <a href="https://trends.vera.org/">Website</a></p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">Last summer, I founded and directed an internship program called <strong>Tech for Equity</strong>. I matched 24 students with paid internships at community-based organizations, managed a team of 4 project managers and scoped 10 technical internship projects (SWE, DS, PM) for interns. Our team raised $61k total funding for first summer program costs and fellowship stipends. <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/tech-for-equity">News Coverage</a>. <a href="https://www.dukeaml.com/techforequity">Program Website</a>.</p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">In the spring, I competed in Duke's largest data competition, Duke DataFest (sponsored by the American Statistical Association). Our challenge was to create predictions on drug addiction in patients by using a convoluted medical dataset based on survey responses. My team won the <strong>Judges' Choice</strong> award for our work on emphasizing the importance on interpretable and explainable modeling in clinical settings. <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/datafest/winners.html">News Coverage</a> </p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I worked on a <Strong>Bass Connections Research Project</Strong> led by Duke Law Professor Brandon Garrett to research the benefits for a publically-accessible online database for jails in North Carolina in the Wilson Center for Science and Justice. <a href="https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/harnessing-data-north-carolinas-jails-inform-effective-policies-2020-2021">Project</a>.</p>
  <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">As a <Strong>Data Plus Research Fellow</Strong> and <strong>Huang Fellow</strong>, I expanded my machine learning and NLP toolbox. I worked with a team of Duke professors and graduate students to investigate the early histories of consumerism. We used word2vec and multiple other language models in Python and R to conduct structural topic modeling and word embeddings on 26,000 old English texts. <a href="https://github.com/albertyusun/For-the-Love-of-Greed">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/love-greed-tracing-early-history-consumer-culture">Project Info</a>.</p>

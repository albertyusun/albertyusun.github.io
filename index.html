	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">In addition, I’m expanding my data science toolbox through <Strong>Duke University’s Data Plus Summer Fellowship</Strong>. I’m working with Duke Professor Astrid Giugni and a wonderful team to investigate the early histories of consumerism using Python scraping tools(concurrent, requests, bs4) and R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, Glove) to conduct Natural Language Processing, network analysis, and word embeddings.</p>

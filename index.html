  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">Hey, I’m Albert Sun!</h1>
    <p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’m a sophomore at Duke University studying <Strong>Data Science: Sociology and Racism</Strong>, a self-designed Bachelor’s degree program. I’m interested in leveraging academic research and personal narratives to understand structural racism in the legal system.</p>
  
  <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:#00539B;">What I’m doing now</h1>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">I’ve been investigating the intersection between science, policy, and law as a <Strong>Huang Fellow</Strong> in Duke’s Science and Society Initiative. I’m working to create the Huang Fellows <Strong>Racial Equity Committee and Initiative</Strong> to invite black speakers/faculty and lead activist action within the Huang Fellows against America’s structural racism and recent murders of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size:23px">In addition, I’m expanding my data science toolbox through <Strong>Duke University’s Data Plus Summer Fellowship</Strong>. I’m working with Duke Professor Astrid Giugni and a wonderful team to investigate the early histories of consumerism using Python scraping tools (concurrent, requests, bs4) and R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, tidytext, GloVe) to conduct Natural Language Processing, network analysis, and word embeddings.</p>
